# About page: what the app is, the annotations it pulls together, and where the
# data comes from. Static content built from bslib cards so it matches the
# dashboard's look.

# One row per annotation card on the dashboard: the label, its source, and a
# one-line description of what it contributes. Kept as data so the table below
# stays in step with the dashboard grid.
