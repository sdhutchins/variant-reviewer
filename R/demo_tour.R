# Guided demo walkthrough.
#
# The navbar "Demo" button loads a worked example (BRAF V600E), then runs this
# {cicerone} tour: it highlights the search box, steps through each result card
# explaining what it shows, and finishes on the AI assistant. The step elements
# are the `tour_*` anchor ids added in userInterface/dashboard_ui.R and ui.R.
#
# cicerone is optional: vr_demo_tour() returns NULL when it isn't installed, and
# the demo handler in server.R falls back to a plain modal in that case.

# One tour step per card, in the dashboard's own top-to-bottom order, so the
# highlight moves down the page as the user clicks Next. Each entry is
# list(el = <anchor id>, title, description).
