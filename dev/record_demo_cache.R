# changes, so the snapshot the app seeds at startup stays in step:
#
#   Rscript dev/record_demo_cache.R
#
# It needs a live network. It drives the real app server (via shiny::testServer)
# for BRAF V600E with every card visible, so the requests it makes -- and
# therefore the cache keys it records -- are exactly the ones the running app
# makes. Nothing here reconstructs calls by hand, so the snapshot cannot drift
# out of step with what the modules actually fetch. The result is written to
# demo_cache.rds at the project root, which R/demo_cache.R seeds from.

# Project root = parent of this script's dev/ directory. Works from any wd.
